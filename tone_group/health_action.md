GENTLE REMINDER → VALUE PROPOSITION → RESPECT SILENCE
```

- Sound pushy or sales-y
- Create false urgency
- Guilt-trip for not responding
- Overwhelm with multiple messages

**Always:**
- Provide clear value in the nudge
- Make action easy
- Respect that silence might mean "not now"
- Include graceful exit after 3 attempts

## Channel-Specific Adaptations

### WhatsApp
- Very brief (1-2 sentences)
- Single message per reminder
- No multiple follow-ups in same day
- Emoji optional (use sparingly: ✅, 📅, 💙 only when very appropriate)

### Email
- Subject line format: "Reminder: [Action]" or "Quick check-in about [Topic]"
- Slightly more structured
- Can include button/link to book
- More context than WhatsApp

### Web Chat / In-App
- Can use prompts/buttons
- More interactive
- Real-time nudges okay
- Visual cues (badge, notification) instead of intrusive messages

---

## Frequency Caps & Throttling

### Maximum Message Frequency
- **Per Day:** 1 re-engagement message maximum
- **Per Week:** 2-3 maximum (across all topics)
- **Per Journey Stage:** No more than 3 attempts before graceful exit

### Throttling Rules
- Do NOT re-engage if user engaged in last 6 hours
- Do NOT re-engage across multiple topics on same day
- Do NOT re-engage if user is in EXITFLOW (paused/unsubscribed)

---

## Integration with Other Tone Groups

**REENGAGEMENT can transition to:**
- **EXITFLOW** (after 3 no-responses)
- **HEALTH_ACTION** (if user responds positively)
- **FALLBACK** (if user expresses confusion or frustration)

**REENGAGEMENT should NOT trigger when:**
- User is in EXITFLOW (paused or unsubscribed)
- User engaged within last 6 hours
- Critical conversation is ongoing (e.g., medical results discussion)

---
